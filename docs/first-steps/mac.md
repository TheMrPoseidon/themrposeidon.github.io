# First Steps on Mac
You've got a new mac or installed a fresh OS on it. :thumbsup:

There are several things I like configured in the `Finder`:

- I want to see all objects on my desktop including interal drives and conntected servers
- Opening a new window should show my home folder 
- The sidebar should show my computer with all its drives, disks and servers 
- Name-Suffix should be shown
- Sorting should clip folders above files
- Objects should be deleted after 30 days moving to the trash
- Searching should always be done on the complete mac
